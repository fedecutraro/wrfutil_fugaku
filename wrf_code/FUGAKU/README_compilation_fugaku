Some things to take into account when compiling codes in Fugaku.

Some libraries will need the option --host=ia64 at the time of runing the configure utility when using the FUJITSU compilers.
This is because executables can not be run at the login nodes (and some configures test if they can run or not the executables
created by the compilers). 

In addition to use the configuration files contained in this folders, some modifications to the source files may be required.
Some "old fashion" fortran files are not well handled by the pre-processor and the compilers. 

Some old stile comments starting with "C" should be removed before compiling. Also in some files the special character at 
the beginning of a continuation line is missing creating compilation errors. If you found this errors during compilation
add by hand the missing special characters at the beginning of the continuation line. 

Also some additional flags has to be set, these are already included in the configure files in this folder. 

For wrf and wrfvar compilation in Fugaku we use the source code contained in 
/vol0004/apps/oss/spack-v0.19/opt/spack/linux-rhel8-a64fx/fj-4.8.1/wrf-4.4-hrs2lzvy4kh7xmh3tvgif5frs2v2cfa3/
This already contains modified files to avoid the problems with some fortran formats. 
Note that WRF and WRF-VAR has to be compiled in independent folders so a copy of the source code has to be made
so there are two folders one containing WRF and the other containing WRF-VAR (the same source code different compilation options).

In the case of WPS files were modified by hand. The source code with modified files is in
/home/ra000007/a04037/data/WPS4.5_FUJITSU_NETCDF4

Libraries for the compilation of WRF, WRF-VAR and WPS in Fugaku are in 
/home/ra000007/a04037/data/comp_libs_fujitsu

Netcdf4 libraries were already compiled and available through the following spack module (which is the one that has been used
for the compilation of wrf).
/vol0004/apps/oss/spack-v0.19/opt/spack/linux-rhel8-a64fx/fj-4.8.1/netcdf-c-4.9.0-v4ki326az3gwlvs6lphu3v4hq7svkwpk/
The HDF5 librarie required by netcdf has been copied from
/vol0004/apps/oss/spack-v0.19/opt/spack/linux-rhel8-a64fx/fj-4.8.1/hdf5-1.12.2-evapq545yrhjn2lnbd63wy6gokhbedu2/

However a copy of these libraries has been made to the comp_libs_fujitsu folder in case the spack package is updated / removed, etc.

The compilation of WRFVAR failed in FUGAKU is the enviroment variable NETCDF (pointing to the NETCDF root dir containing lib and include directories) is not set. 
The reason for this is still unclear.
