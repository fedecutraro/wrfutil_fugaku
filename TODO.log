Things to be improved.

-Merge the current LETKF version with the latest version.
-Add additional flags of LETKF namelist to the configuration files.
-Translate the documentation to English including the comments written in the scripts.
-Translate some variable names into English so the code is more friendly and easy to understand. 
-[This is done. Should be work authomatically when the number of characters defining the ensemble size is expanded in the configuration files.]Expand the maximum number of ensemble members. Ideally the number should contain 5 digits as in the LETKF. 
-Add the observation linking to the run_LETKF script to be able to actually assimilate data.
