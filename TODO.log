Things to be improved.

-Merge the current LETKF version with the latest version.
-Add the tar creation to the experiment creation script. 
-Simplify the compilation of wrf-letkf and other associated tools (wrf_to_wps, pert_met_em, spawners ... )
-Add additional flags of LETKF namelist to the configuration files.
-Consider the possibility of running WPS only on the times corresponding to boundary files and the performing
 linear time interpolation on met_em files on each cycle (to reduce computational cost). 
-Translate the documentation to English including the comments written in the scripts.
-Translate some variable names into English so the code is more friendly and easy to understand. 
-Expand the maximum number of ensemble members. Ideally the number should contain 5 digits as in the LETKF.
-Add the observation linking to the run_LETKF script to be able to actually assimilate data.
